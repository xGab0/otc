This module extends the functionality of Contracts and Attendances to support
recalculating Overtime and to allow you to keep up to date your Overtime.

You can Update Overtime in different ways:
- An action on the Contract History tree view
- Header button on Contract History form view
- Header button on Contract form view

If you Update Overtime from Contract History, leaves will also be reorganized
across their contract calendars.
