This module extends the functionality of Contracts and Attendances to
support recalculating Overtime and to allow you to keep up to date your
Overtime.

You can Update Overtime in different ways:

-  An action on the Contract History tree view
-  Header button on Contract History form view
-  Header button on Contract form view

If you Update Overtime from Contract History, leaves will also be
reorganized across their contract calendars.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
